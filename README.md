# 🎵 AI_Aur_Aai - A Song from the Corporate Daughter’s Heart

## 🎧 Audio Title:
**AI_Aur_Aai**

## 📝 Description:
"AI_Aur_Aai" is an emotionally driven Hindi-English fusion song told from the perspective of a daughter lost in the fast-paced corporate world. Torn between artificial intelligence and her real source of warmth — her mother (Aai in Marathi) — the song explores the contrast between machine-made logic and the unconditional love only a mother can provide. The track blends soulful acoustic vibes with soft lo-fi beats, and features a duet-style vocal flow to reflect this emotional dichotomy.

## 🛠️ Tools and AI Resources Used:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **ChatGPT** | For songwriting and lyrical refinement. Helped craft emotional verses, structure, and ensure clarity in dual pronunciation of "A-I" and "Aai". |

## ⚠️ Known Issues and Limitations:
- Suno AI does not allow direct editing of previously generated songs. New lyrics require full regeneration, which may change the instrumental slightly.
- Vocal control is limited — singer tone/style may vary on different generations even with the same prompt.
- Length constraints in Suno may require trimming of lyrics for longer songs.
- Voice output is not customizable beyond general tone (e.g., no specific gender, accent, or identity selection).
